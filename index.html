        <p class="hello"> Chemical engineering is a branch of engineering which deals with the study of design 
            and operation of chemical plants and methods of improving production. Chemical engineers develop
             economical commercial processes to convert raw material into useful products. Chemical engineering
              uses principles of chemistry, physics, mathematics, biology, and economics to efficiently use, 
              produce, design, transport and transform energy and materials. The work of chemical engineers can
               range from the utilization of nanotechnology and nanomaterials in the laboratory to 
               large-scale industrial processes that convert chemicals, raw materials, living cells, 
               microorganisms, and energy into useful forms and products.
        </p>
        <p class="hello">Chemical engineers are involved in many aspects of plant design and operation, including safety and hazard 
            assessments, process design and analysis, modeling, control engineering, chemical reaction engineering, 
            nuclear engineering, biological engineering, construction specification, and operating instructions.
